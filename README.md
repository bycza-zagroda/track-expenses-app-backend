## About project
This project is created by [_Bycza Zagroda_](https://github.com/bycza-zagroda) community.
The main aim for this project is for it to allow a user to track their own expenses.
The code for the Track Expenses App is separated for [back-end](https://github.com/bycza-zagroda/track-expenses-app-backend) and [front-end](https://github.com/bycza-zagroda/track-expenses-app-frontend) with
their own GitHub repository. In the application the [_REST_](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architecture and [_Minimum
Viable Product (MVP)_](https://www.parp.gov.pl/component/content/article/52414:minimum-viable-product) model is used.

## Initial assumptions of the application
- this is a small project in order to build and release with the best code practise.
- the base of the application is able to execute the most basic actions such as:
  _create_, _read_, _update_, _delete_, aka [CRUD](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD)
- in this project we can work together, learn from each other and enlarge our skills
  or even develop them. Everything depends on which level knowledge of Spring Boot 2
  you have.

- [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) / [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
