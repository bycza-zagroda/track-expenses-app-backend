# Project Open Source: Track Expenses App Back-end
This project is created by “Bycza Zagroda” community.
The main aim for this project is for it to allow a user to track their own expenses.
The code for the Track Expenses App is separated for back-end and front-end with
their own Github repository. In the application the REST architecture and Minimum
Viable Product (MVP) model is used.

## Prerequisites:
The following tools are required to start the application:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) / [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/),
- [Java 17 LTS](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/),
- [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) / [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/),
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
- [Maven 3.x](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi),
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/),
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). How to set up the Docker depends on
  your operating system. For now, the database is booted on the docker. However, it is
  not required until the 1.0 version and it is allowed to use a local database.

### Initial assumptions of the application:
- this is a small project in order to build and release with the best code practise.
- the base of the application is able to execute the most valid actions such as:
  add-, find-, change, delete-element
- in this project we can work together, learn from each other and enlarge our skills
  or even develop them. Everything depends on which level knowledge of Spring Boot 2
  you have.
