## Starting work with the task

1. Go to [our repository](https://github.com/bycza-zagroda/track-expenses-app-backend), and select fork.

![create fork](images/img001_create_fork.png)

---

2.Expand branches and click link **_View all branches_**.

![view all branchesz](images/img002_switch_branch.png)

---

3. Create new branch **_New branch_** and fill form as below with the name of the branch for your task. Use pattern ↓

- **_feature/numberOfIssue-name-Of-Issue_** for new feature. For example: feature/22-Domain-structure-of-money-wallet
- **_bugfix/numberOfIssue-name-Of-Issue_** - for bugfixes. For example: bugfix/22-Domain-structure-of-money-walle

⚠ Make sure you choose **_develop_** as source branch

## Local repository

1. Clone repository with

### Git

`git clone https://github.com/bycza-zagroda/track-expenses-app-backend.git`

### IntelliJ IDEA

![IntelliJ Import Step 1](images/img008_intellij_import_step_1.png)
![IntelliJ Import Step 2](images/img008_intellij_import_step_2.png)
![IntelliJ Import Step 3](images/img008_intellij_import_step_3.png)

---

2. In local project directory execute commands: (`--allow-empty` allows us to execute commit without any changes in the project)

```shell
git commit -m "getting started" --allow-empty
git push
```

---

3. Back to [your repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bycza-zagroda/track-expenses-app-backend), click **_Pull requests_** and **_New pull request_** button. 

![new pull request](images/img004_new_pull_request.png)

---

4. Select project repository as base repository and **_develop_** as a base branch. 
Head repository should point to your repository and field compare - new created branch.
Click **_Create pull request_** button.

![create draft pull request](images/img005_create_pull_request.png)

---

5. On the next page make sure that you have correctly set branches (develop in project repository, newly created in yours),
that you selected **_Create draft pull request_** and click on button **_Draft pull request_**.

![create draft pull request](images/img006_draft_pull_request.png)

---

Now you can start working with the task. 

## Commits
Commit should be done according to the image below:
for example for new feature: "feat: add new image: img009_commits_message.png to the documentation"
![commits](images/img009_commits_message.png)

Additionally, If this is code review, commit should start: "code review: message"

## Resolving conflicts
[based on github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

Before start code review you should check that there isn't exists any conflicts between your and bycza-zagroda repository. 

![conflict file](images/img015_conflict_file.png)

You can resolve conflicts in the following way (using command line). 
1. Syncing a fork
```shell
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/mirekgab1/upstream-repository.git
```

After that you can see in IntelliJ that you have setting up upstream.

![upstream branch](images/img010_upstream.png)

2. Fetch the branches from the upstream repository
```shell
git fetch upstream
```

3. Checkout to you fork's local branch - in this case, we use feature/1-feature-name
```shell
git checkout feature/1-feature-name
```

4. Merget the changes from the upstream develop branch into your local feature/1-feature-name branch. 
```shell
git merge upstream/develop
```
If there is any conflicts you see information like to this below
```shell
Aktualizowanie b73c31c..ceeb96d
error: Scalenie nadpisałoby zmiany w następujących plikach:
        MyClass.java
Złóż swoje zmiany lub dodaj do schowka zanim je scalisz.
Przerywanie
```
5. Resolve conflicts using IntelliJ
In IntelliJ you can see conflict files in Project window are displayed in red. When you open that file, you see which lines needs resolving conflicts.

![conflicts in IntelliJ](images/img011_resolve_conflicts_intellij.png)

You can use IntelliJ editor to merge this changes and resolve conflicts. 
Click the right mouse button on the file with conflict, in menu select Git-> Resolve Conflicts. You see this window.

![merge conflicts files](images/img012_conflicts.png)

Click Merget button and you see editor

![merge revision](images/img013_merge_revision.png)

You have there three panels: left shows your version of the file, right shows the upstream version of the file.
In the middle you have final version. Decide if you want to keep only your brnach's changes, keep only the upstream changes,
or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
and make the changes you want int the final merge. 
After resolve all conflict you can click Applay button. 

![finish merging](images/img014_merge_revision_finish.png)

Next commit and push you changes
```shell
git commit -m "merging with upstream"
git push
```
And you successfully resolve conflicts.

## Code review

Code review can be started from opened draft pull request. You can open it in several ways, below described one of it.
Go to project page and open **_Pull requests_** page. Find yours on the list and open it. Next, click the button **_Ready for review_**. 
 
![ready for review](images/img007_ready_for_review.png)

## Completing work with the task

After completing work with the task give an information to the leader that you ask for code review. 
Then Leader assign reviewer for your task and that you are waiting for checking. 
If there is some cases to improve, you need to improve them and give information to your reviewer that you finished. 
Next the leaders check that your changes can be merged to upstream.
