# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community 
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or 
invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, 
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual 
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and 
healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning 
from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, 
without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable 
behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour 
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this 
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual 
is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community
include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the 
project team at Discord. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and will 
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. 
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or 
permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project leaders will follow these Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation 
of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Project Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or 
unwelcome in the project.

**Consequence**: AA private, written warning from project leaders, providing clarity around 
the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. 
A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Project Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**:A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. Project members whose

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Project Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained 
inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of public interaction or communication with the 
project community for a specified period of time. Project members whose violate the

these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Project Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, 
including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression
